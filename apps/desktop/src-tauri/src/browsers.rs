//! Keeping the browsers honest during a session. Each browser with the Seiza extension
//! starts a bridge that links it to the app (link.rs), and that link lasts exactly as long as
//! the extension runs. So a browser that's running without a link during a session has had
//! the extension turned off or removed, and its sites aren't being tamed.
//!
//! Only sessions whose profile tames sites are watched; a session spent in other apps doesn't
//! need the browser. What happens then is a warning, unless "close browsers" is on in
//! Settings (it's opt-in, so the app and extension can each be used alone). With it on, it
//! depends on the session's strictness:
//! - Gentle, or no timer running: a warning.
//! - Medium: a warning, then the browser is closed a minute later.
//! - Hard: the same, and the session counts as broken.
