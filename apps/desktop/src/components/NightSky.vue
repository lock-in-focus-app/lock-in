// The night sky behind the window (PLAN §5): one canvas, drawn by code. The constellations come
// from the reward engine (packages/core/src/constellations.ts); this only draws them, with light
// pollution washing them out as `clarity` falls. It redraws 60 times a second while stars twinkle
// or the haze is moving (20 while the window is behind others), every frame the screen shows while
// something moves, only when something changes under reduced motion, and not at all while hidden.
//
// It has two layouts, and constellations glide from one to the other. On the Sky (`sky`), they
// gather close together, the newest in the middle, like one starry collection. Exploring spreads
// them out, and hovering one there brightens it and shows its name beneath it. In the weekly report (`week`), they line up in week
// order, with the week being looked at large and soft behind the page's header.
//
// With `drift` on (exploring the Sky page), the sky leans and zooms gently toward the pointer, like
// nudging a telescope, with brighter (nearer) stars moving a little more for depth. It can also be
// dragged around and zoomed (the wheel, a pinch, the keyboard or `zoom`), out as far as the oldest
// constellation.
//
// To stay smooth after years of focus (PLAN §5, performance at scale), the Sky shows a month's
// constellations at a time, the latest unless `month` steps back, and the rest fold away into the
// Milky Way, which fills in behind everything as total focus grows. Exploring starts on the latest
// weeks, and zooming out finds the rest; far away, a constellation's stars fold into a soft glow. Only what's on screen is drawn,
// and still things are drawn once and reused.
//
// Planets (one a month) sit nearer than the stars, around the edge of the constellations, the
// newest largest. On the Sky, the last few months' are still; exploring shows them all, slowly
// circling, with their moons going round. In the weekly report, the week's month's planet sits
// faintly beside its constellation.
//
// Comets and rare events (skyEvents.ts) play once, the first time they're in `play`. Comets and
// the nebulae supernovae leave stay beside their week's constellation, behind its stars.
//
// Satellites (satellite.ts) slowly circle the constellations on the Sky and while exploring, each
// on its own orbit, nearest of all. They fade in when launched and out when deleted, and one
// ticked off drifts away the first time it's in `play`. What one says shows beneath it on hover
// only with `satelliteText` (exploring between sessions). Under reduced motion they sit still.
